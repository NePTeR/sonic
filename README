Sonic to its full potential.

SIMPLE INSTALLATION
1.  Download latest source from: [url_goes_here]
2.  tar xzvf sonic.tar.gz && cd sonic
3.  ./install /path/to/install/to AppName
4.  follow instructions in /path/to/install/to/SETUP file

ADVANCED INSTALLATION

1.  Download latest source from: [url_goes_here]
2.  Create a directory somewhere where you want the application to live
3.  Within that directory add the sonic library from step 1 and some other
    directories and files that the app will need.

    You want your application structure to look like this:

    [] = directory
     • = file

    [] totally_awesome_application
           [] configs
                  • app.php
                  • routes.php
           [] controllers
                  • main.php
           [] lib
                  [] Sonic (downloaded in step 1)
           [] public_html
                  • .htaccess
                  [] assets
                         [] css
                         [] img
                         [] js
                  • index.php
           [] views
                  [] main
                         • index.phtml
                         • error.phtml

4.  In your /public_html/.htaccess file add the following:

    SetEnv ENVIRONMENT development
    RewriteEngine On
    RewriteRule ^.htaccess$ - [F,L]
    RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} -f [OR]
    RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} -d
    RewriteRule ^.*$ - [NC,L]
    RewriteRule ^.*$ /index.php [NC,L]

5.  In your /public_html/index.php file add the following:
    <?php
    set_include_path(str_replace('/public_html', '/lib', $_SERVER['DOCUMENT_ROOT']));
    include 'Sonic/Core.php';
    $app = \Sonic\App::getInstance();

    // if you would like autoloading uncomment this line
    // $app->enableAutoload();

    $app->start();

6.  Setup an apache vhost to point to your /public_html directory with
    DirectoryIndex set to index.php and add the server name to your /etc/hosts.
7.  That's all there is to it, but your app won't work until you add some
    controllers and views.  For a more complete tutorial visit:
